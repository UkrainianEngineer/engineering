Overview
========

The COVID-19 (a.k.a. coronavirus) virus is leading companies to (at least temporarily) ask their employees to work
from home.

To make this kind of work effective there
should be a couple of things taken into account:

**1. Work from anywhere you want**

    Working remotely allows you to be there for the ones you love, and be more available for them.
    It allows you to see more places, without ever having to commute. On top of that, working remotely removes
    almost every distraction.

    Also, less time spent commuting.
