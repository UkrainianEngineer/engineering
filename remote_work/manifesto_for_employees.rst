Challenges of Remote Work
_________________________

**1. Communication**

    *Problem statement:*
        - You might want to have a video call with your employee, but you can’t because they are asleep.
        - A lot of task switching and email overload because of mentions of tasks that can wait for a few hours or even a few days.

    *Solution:*
        * Use a modern project management tools like Slack, Asana to manage your teams effectively.
        * Enhance communication within the team with the help of Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Google Hangouts or similar tools.

**2. Tracking**

    *Problem statement:*
        - It is difficult to track the performance of your employees when they are working remotely.

    *Solution:*
        * Communicate the expectations from day one.
        * Use time-tracking tools to have a quick look at what employees did throughout the day.

**3. Effective work from home with kids**

    *Problem statement:*
        - It can be a great call to be working efficiently when you have your kid/children in the same space with you.

    *Solution:*
        * Write a schedule together with a child, agree upon it and hang at a visible place.
        * Divide your activity into chunks of time: 45 min work, 15 min break for chat with a child and domestic churns around the house.
        * Gamify everything you can.
        * Don’t be shy to introduce your child to the Customer or other people you are regularly having calls with.

    After the quarantine is finished:
        * Hire a nanny who lives nearby for several hours a day to play with a child.
        * Send a child to stay with grandparents.
        * Find the time when you have the most important meeting and make the child busy with the most exiting activity for they (cartoons, video games, tablets)

Tips for effective Remote Work
______________________________

**1. Work from anywhere you want**

    Working remotely allows you to be there for the ones you love, and be more available for them.
    It allows you to see more places, without ever having to commute. On top of that, working remotely removes
    almost every distraction.

    Less time spent commuting.

**2. Communicate Asynchronously**

    Reduce task switching and put an end to email overload. You might want to have a video call with your employee,
    but you can’t because they are asleep.
